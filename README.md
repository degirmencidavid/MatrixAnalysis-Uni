# MatrixAnalysis-Uni
A repo of some of my code for my MA398 Matrix Analysis &amp; Algorithm module at the University of Warwick

**Assignment 1** is mainly about LU decomposition, **Assigmnent 2** is mostly about SVD decomposition, image compression using SVD and Polynomial (over) fitting, **Assignment 3** is about Jacobi and SOR methods, as well as implementations of Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient algorithms.

All assignments were awarded 95%+
